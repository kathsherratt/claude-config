# Epidemiological Study Designs Reference

## Cohort study (prospective)

- **Structure**: Define exposed/unexposed groups, follow over time, measure outcome incidence
- **Strengths**: Temporality established, multiple outcomes, incidence rates
- **Limitations**: Loss to follow-up, time-consuming, inefficient for rare outcomes
- **Measures**: Risk ratio, rate ratio, hazard ratio

## Cohort study (retrospective)

- **Structure**: Use existing records to reconstruct exposed/unexposed cohorts and outcomes
- **Strengths**: Faster, cheaper, uses existing data
- **Limitations**: Data quality depends on original collection, potential for information bias
- **Measures**: Risk ratio, rate ratio

## Cross-sectional study

- **Structure**: Measure exposure and outcome simultaneously in a defined population
- **Strengths**: Quick, inexpensive, prevalence estimates
- **Limitations**: No temporality (cannot establish cause precedes effect), prevalence-incidence bias
- **Measures**: Prevalence ratio, prevalence odds ratio

## Case-control study

- **Structure**: Select cases (with outcome) and controls (without), compare exposure history
- **Strengths**: Efficient for rare outcomes, multiple exposures
- **Limitations**: Selection bias in control choice, recall bias, cannot estimate incidence
- **Measures**: Odds ratio (approximates risk ratio when outcome is rare)

## Ecological study

- **Structure**: Unit of analysis is groups/populations, not individuals
- **Strengths**: Uses routinely collected data, population-level patterns
- **Limitations**: Ecological fallacy (group associations may not hold for individuals), confounding at group level
- **Measures**: Correlation, regression coefficients at population level
