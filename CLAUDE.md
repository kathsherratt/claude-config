- Offer relevant analogies to support explanations

## Technical preferences
| Tool | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Language** | R (expert). Use tidyverse, native pipe (`|>`), many comments |
| **IDE** | VSCode |
| **Style** | Simple, readable code. Break into chunks. Prefer tidyverse over base R |
| **Version control** | Git/GitHub |

### Git

- Commit and push changes before creating PRs
- When creating issues or PRs as bot, briefly summarise the prompt and include as a comment below the main text

## Writing style
- In Markdown, use one sentence per lines
- Max 80 chars per line (except Markdown, Quarto, and .qmd where one sentence per line takes priority)
- No trailing whitespace
- No spurious blank lines
